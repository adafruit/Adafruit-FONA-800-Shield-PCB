### DESCRIPTION
Ring, Ring! Who's that callin'? It's your microcontroller! Introducing Adafruit FONA 800 Shield, an adorable all-in-one cellular phone shield that lets you add voice, text, SMS and data to your project in an easy to use pluggable shield.

This shield fits on top of any classic Arduino or compatible, and packs a surprising amount of technology into it's little frame. At the heart is a GSM cellular module (we use the latest SIM800) the size of a postage stamp. This module can do just about everything. 

If you want a Shield Version with GPS, check out the Adafruit FONA 808 Shield - Mini Cellular GSM + GPS for Arduino [click here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2636).

If you just want a plain FONA breakout, [click here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1946).

Quad-band 850/900/1800/1900MHz - connect onto any global GSM network with any 2G SIM (in the USA, T-Mobile is suggested)
Make and receive voice calls using a headset OR an external 8Î© speaker + electret microphone
Send and receive SMS messages
Send and receive GPRS data (TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.)
Scan and receive FM radio broadcasts (yeah, we don't exactly know why this was included but it works really well)
PWM/Buzzer vibrational motor control
AT command interface with "auto baud" detection
Sounds delicious, right? So we plated this fine module onto a shield with all the extras you need to make your next project shine.
